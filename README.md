# TCP-Client-Server-Communication-using-Socket-Programming
This project demonstrates TCP Client-Server communication using socket programming in C.

The main aim of this project is to build a client program that can connect to the specified target server and exchange information via TCP.

This program has been specifically built for Windows environment. It utilizes Winsock library. Certain modifications has to be made to the application for it to be working in UNIX-based environments.
